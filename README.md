# Purpose
I built this website as my first project for the code institutes full stack development and e-commerce applications course. 
I built this website from scratch using the knowledge I gained from the course where I studied the basics of HTML and CSS.

## Tommy Keys Car Sales
This website was built for Thomas Keys, a car dealership owner in the North West of Ireland. Mr Keys asked for a website which would be fully responsive and run across a multitude of devices such as phones, tablets and desktops and which would display his business in a positive light and bring more customers to the dealership. Mr Keys wanted a website to show his cars that were for sale, make it easy for customers to find the dealership and make contacting the dealership simple and also show people the story of his dealership and what they were about.
