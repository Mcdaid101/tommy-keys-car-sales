# Purpose
I built this website as my first project for the code institutes full stack development and e-commerce applications course. 
I built this website from scratch using the knowledge I gained from the course where I studied the basics of HTML and CSS. 

You can find a link to the live website [here](https://mcdaid101.github.io/tommy-keys-car-sales/).	

## Tommy Keys Car Sales
![Website Mock Up](assets/readme.images/Multi%20Screen%20screenshot%20.png)
This website was built for Thomas Keys, a car dealership owner in the North West of Ireland. Mr Keys asked for a website which would be fully responsive and run across a multitude of devices such as phones, tablets and desktops and which would display his business in a positive light and bring more customers to the dealership. Mr Keys wanted a website to show his cars that were for sale, make it easy for customers to find the dealership and make contacting the dealership simple and also show people the story of his dealership and what they were about.

## Colour
The website was designed to look modern and futuristic and appealing to those looking for new sleek vehicles. The colors whitesmoke (#f5f5f5) and regular grey are the main colors of each webpage are used to replicate the colour theme of most modern car showrooms. Modern car Showrooms are full of light and bright white shades which highlight the cars inside and make them the center of attention, something I have tried to recreate in this website.
For my elements with hover options I used a yellow colour (#e5cc5d) and a red colour (#e55d5d) to highlight being interacted with. 
<br>

## Fonts
The main font family used is imported from the Google Fonts website and is called 'Playfair Display', this font has been used extensively throughout the website as it looks professional and suits the theme of the website any other text areas are in 'sans serif' mainly which are less important and serve as non heading elements and text areas.
